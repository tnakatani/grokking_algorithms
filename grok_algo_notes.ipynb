    "## Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- With binary search, you guess the middle number and eliminate half the remaining numbers every time.\n",
    "- When talking about running time in Big O notation, log always means log<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "- In general, for any list of `n`, binary search will take log<sub>2</sub>`n` steps to run in the worst case, whereas simple search will take `n` steps.\n",
    "  - For a list of 8 numbers, binary search will require log<sub>2</sub>8 (3).\n",
    "  - For a list of 1024 numbers, binary search will require log<sub>2</sub>1024 (10) \n",
    "- Binary search only work if your list is in sorted order.\n",
    "- Binary search runs in _logarithmic time_, as opposed to _linear time_\n",
    "  - For example, what takes a simple search 100ms to run can be done in 7ms with binary search (log<sub>2</sub>100).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Exercises__\n",

    "\n",
    "- __Big O Notation__ is a special type of notation that tells you how fast an algorithm is.\n",
    "- Big O lets you __compare the number of operations__ between algorithms.\n",
    "  - `O(n)`: `O` is \"Big O\", `n` is number of operations.\n",
    "- For example, given a list of size `n`:\n",
    "  - Simple search needs to check each element. Run time in Big O is `O(n)`\n",
    "  - Binary search needs to log `n` operations to check the same. Run time in Big O is `O(log n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Big O run times\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorted from fastest to slowest:\n",
    "- `O(log n)`, also known as log time. Example: Binary search.\n",
    "- `O(n),` also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.\n",
    "- `O(n * log n).` Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort (coming up in chapter 4).\n",
    "- `O(n2)`. Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort (coming up in chapter 2).\n",
    "- `O(n!)`. Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson (coming up next!).\n",

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.\n",
    "- Instead, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.\n",
    "- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation.\n",
    "- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster as the list of items you’re searching grows.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, Linked Lists = Dicts and Arrays = Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLs are more efficients than arrays because each items doesn't have to be adjacent in memory.\n",
    "  - Each item in a linked list has the address of next item.\n",
    "- OTOH, arrays are faster at reading elements since they are next to each other.\n",
    "- Arrays have fast reads and slow inserts.\n",
    "- Linked Lists have slow reads and fast inserts.\n",
    "- Linked Lists are easier to insert elements into the middle. Array require reshuffling.  Same with deleting items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selection Sort \n",
    "\n",
    "- Used for sorting names, dates, etcs.\n",
    "- Slower than Quicksort (explained later)\n",
    "- Big O: `O(n)`, \n",
    "  - Each sorting operation requires algorithm to check each item in the list.\n",
    "  - Big O is constant even though the number of items to check decreases each time.  Technically, selection sort is `O(n*0.5n)` based on average number of checks in a list, but constants like `0.5` are ignored in Big O notation.\n",

    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Figure out base case, ie. the simplest possible case\n",
    "2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.\n",

    "Given an array of number, sum the numbers and return the total in a recursive way.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Pick a pivot\n",
    "2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "3. Call quicksort recursively on the two sub-arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort performance heavily depends on the pivot you use. If you're taking the pivot from the first item in a list, it is functioning basically the same way as going through a loop. If you start from the middle of the array, it would be much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the pivot from the first item in a list would be the worst-case scenario (height of call stack stack is `O(n)`, while taking a pivot from the middle would be a best case scenario (height of the call stack is `O(log n)`.  If you always choose a random element as the pivot, __you will get the best case consistently__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- D&C works by breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller pieces. If you’re using D&C on a list, the base case is probably an empty array or an array with one element.\n",
    "- If you’re implementing quicksort, choose a random element as the pivot. The average runtime of quicksort is `O(n log n)`!\n",
    "- The constant in Big O notation can matter sometimes. That’s why quicksort is faster than merge sort.\n",
    "- The constant almost never matters for simple search versus binary search, because `O(log n)` is so much faster than `O(n)` when your list gets big.\n",

    "## Hash functions\n",

    "- A hash function is a function that maps strings to numbers.\n",
    "- The number can be associated to the index of an array, in which the index stores the return value (number, string, etc)\n",
    "- The hash function knows how big your array is and only returns valid indexes.\n",
    "- Has many names, depending on language: hash maps, maps, dictionaries, and associative arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the dictionary object has the `get()` function which returns a value if the key is in the hash table.  If not, it will return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it doesn't have to check every item in a list like an array, ideally it will have _constant time_, ie. it has a call stack height of `O(1)` where the time taken to perform an operation stays the same, regardless of how big the hash table is.\n",

    "Simplified example of how caching works:\n",

    "- Filtering out duplicates\n",
    "- Caching/memorizing data instead of making your server do work\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collisions and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideally, your hash function should map keys evenly all over the hash. When it doesn't and map keys to the same hash, it's called a _collision_. To get around this, a simple workaround is to use a _linked list_.\n",
    "- A poor hash function could map all keys to a single slot and create one long _linked list_ (i.e. a key with an value that maps to another key and so forth).  This would be as slow as putting all the items in a list.\n",
    "- To avoid collisions, you need 1) a low load factor (number of items in a hash table / total number of slots) and 2) a good hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can make a hash table by combining a hash function with an array.\n",
    "- Collisions are bad. You need a hash function that minimizes collisions.\n",
    "- Hash tables have really fast search, insert, and delete.\n",
    "- Hash tables are good for modeling relationships from one item to another item.\n",
    "- Once your load factor is greater than 0.7, it’s time to resize your hash table.\n",
